        <h3>The Rise of Streaming Services</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest innovations in the music industry is the rise of streaming services. Platforms like
            Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music have revolutionized how we consume music, providing easy access to a
            vast library of songs. Music streaming has become an increasingly popular way of listening, sharing, and downloading new music
            that has taken over the world through the lens of our mobile devices we use on a daily basis.
            The streaming industry has completely changed the music industry, from the quality of the music to 
            the distribution and how we access and consume music.  </p>

<p>With music streaming services allowing a more on-demand service, listeners have absolute power over options, including the genre, artist, song order, and lyrics.
     As a result, people can pick and choose what they want to listen to without any limitations. They can also create customized playlists of their own,
      search different playlists to save, and share playlists with others that they use for various activities such as driving in the car, exercising, or working. This has not been without 
      a level of controversy however, especially in the last year as many musicians have spoken out against the rise in music streaming 
      and how they are not getting paid fairly for their music. It has come out in recent years that artists, especially smaller and more underground artists, make almost no money off 
      of the music they put out any more and that almost all of their minimal revenue they get is from touring and merchandise. As of 2023, music streaming makes up over 84% of music industry revenue
    and the music streaming industry grew by over 10% over the last year. This all equates to over 17.5 billion dollars in valuation and revenues for this industry. To say it has taken a stranglehold on our 
lives in an understatement. Only 16.1% of revenue now comes from physical music sales such as CD's or vinyl. These are the most profitable forms of media from an artists perspective and is a clear reason for why so many artists 
are frustrated by the rise of streaming. According to stats via "Exploding Topics", the streaming industry market is expected to grow to over 30 billion dollars by 2027. Insane!</p>
