        <h3>Social Media and Music Marketing</h3>
        <p>In today's digital age, the rise of social media has transformed the way we connect, share, and discover new content. This is probably most well represented through the use
            of modern music industry marketing tactics utilizing the bredth of social media to gain competitive advantage in the market. With platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube,
             musicians and record companies executives alike have found new avenues to reach and engage with their audience as well as gaining new fans. Avid music consumers are now able to post about 
            their favorite artists, songs, or albums and reach potentially thousands of people within seconds. The introduction of social media "influencers" have also become a viable and highly valuable asset
            to music marketing agencies in getting their clients and artists heard by entirely new demographics and audiences </p>

             <p>Some of the best ways various social media platforms can help build your brand either as a music company or as a band are through amplifying reach, targeted advertising, real-time feebback and market research, as well as building a devited and dedicated fanbase.
                According to Kepios analysis, "as of July 2023 total of 4.88 billion distinct user identities accessed social media platforms." This equates to about 60.6% of the world's total population. This is in comparison to in 2015 when just under 30% of the world's total population was using social media
                and shows a rapid and staggering increase over the last 8 years where this figure has over doubled. That is a lot of people you are able to reach with your music just through social media, and now album sales and constant touring are not the only ways to get your 
                music to the masses and gain support from different areas of the country or even the world.</p>
