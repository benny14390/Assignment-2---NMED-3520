        <h3>Virtual Reality Concerts</h3>
        <p>Probably the craziest innovation in the music industry over the last year or two has been the introduction of VR concerts into the music world and the wide availibility of them for the average consumer.
            This trend reached the masses in the last calender year when start-up tech company based out of LA called AmazeVR. Last year. they produced one of the first widely distributed full VR concerts experiences
        featuring famed pop star "Megan Thee Stallion." Now this year, the company is working on a longer and more innovative VR concert using famous rapper "T-PAIN", as well as the K-Pop group AESPA. These works
        are proving that not only is there the possibility of VR concerts, but here is a demand for them too, as fans are seemingly lining up for this technology to experience their favorite artists in concert in the comfort of their own homes!
        The COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the cancellation of live concerts and events, further accelerated the interest and demand for VR concerts in 2020 and 2021. A  few of the larger artists and musicians turned to virtual
         platforms to connect with their fans and provide immersive concert experiences. Many of these were just paid live streams for example and not the virtual reality experience that we are now seeing pop up with these examples listed above.
         This shift in the status quo however accelerated the need for a more virtual way to experience live shows and ultimately led to the ongoing research and development of these new VR shows. 2023 has been a breakthrough year for virtual reality concerts
         and has set up a technologically sound leaping pad to continue to improve this technology further and further!
